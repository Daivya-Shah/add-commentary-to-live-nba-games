# Supabase Data Model

Supabase provides video storage, analysis persistence, evaluations, and optional Live Replay review tables.

## Storage

Bucket:

## Persistence Rules

Direct FastAPI mode persists only when both backend variables are present:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

Edge Function mode persists through the function's Supabase service client.

For `POST /analyze`:

- insert detection.
- insert retrieved context.
- insert commentary.

For `POST /regenerate`:

- when stored detection is reused, insert commentary only.
- when full analysis reruns, insert detection, retrieved context, and commentary.

For Live Replay:

- session and caption persistence is optional and depends on backend Supabase service credentials.

## Edge Function Behavior

`process-video` accepts:

```json
{
  "clip_id": "uuid",
  "file_url": "https://...",
  "action": "regenerate"
}
```

If `VISION2VOICE_BACKEND_URL` is set, it proxies to:

- `/analyze`
- `/regenerate` when `action` is `regenerate`

If `VISION2VOICE_BACKEND_URL` is not set, it returns deterministic mock analysis and persists mock rows.

## RLS Posture

The current migrations enable RLS and then add broad public read/insert policies, plus public update on commentaries, evaluations, and live sessions.

This is suitable for a demo or unauthenticated tool. For production, tighten policies around:

- authenticated clip ownership.
- private storage objects.
- server-only inserts for detections and retrieved context.
- restricted updates to evaluations and live session statuses.
- service-role-only writes from the backend or Edge Function.
